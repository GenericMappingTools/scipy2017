# Bringing the Generic Mapping Tools to Python

Talk proposal about the [new Python
interface](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt-python) for Scipy 2017.


## Abstract

~100 words.

> Who is the intended audience for your talk?

> What, specifically, will attendees learn from your talk?

> Include links to source code, articles, blog posts, or other writing that
> adds context to the presentation.

## Extended Abstract

> Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your detailed
> description. This should be a roughly 500 word detailed outline of your
> presentation. This outline should concisely describe software of interest to
> the SciPy community, tools or techniques for more effective computing, or how
> scientific Python was applied to solve a research problem. A traditional
> background/motivation, methods, results, and conclusion structure is
> encouraged but not required. Links to project websites, source code
> repositories, figures, full papers, and evidence of public speaking ability
> are encouraged.



> Does it have a traditional background/motivation, methods, results, and
> conclusion structure?

> If you've given a talk, tutorial, or other presentation before, include that
> information as well as a link to slides or a video if they're available.



Answer these:


> Do you intend to present a demo?

> Does the work make any new contributions to open-source software?

> Which existing open-source tools does it use?

> What science fields are impacted by the work?

> How does it work fit into the Scientific Python community?
