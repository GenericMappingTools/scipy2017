# Bringing the Generic Mapping Tools to Python

[Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)
and
[Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/)


Talk at Scipy 2017.

* See the initial [talk
  proposal](http://www.leouieda.com/blog/scipy2017-proposal-gmt.html).
* Read the [reviews we got and our
  replies](http://www.leouieda.com/blog/scipy2017-reviews.html).
* The slides are in file `slides.pdf`
* There is a [Jupyter notebook with the live
  demo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GenericMappingTools/scipy2017/blob/master/demo.ipynb).
* Create a conda environment to install what you need (based on
  `environment.yml`). **Only works for Linux right now**.


## Abstract

The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is an open-source software package widely used
in the geosciences to process and visualize time series and gridded data.
Maps generated by GMT are ubiquitous in scientific publications in areas such
as seismology and oceanography.
We present a new GMT Python wrapper library built by the GMT team.
We will show the design plans, internal implementations, and demonstrate an
initial prototype of the library.
Our wrapper connects to the GMT C API using ctypes and allows input and
output using data from numpy ndarrays and xarray Datasets.
The library is still in early stages of design and implementation and
we are eager for contributions and feedback from the Scipy community.
